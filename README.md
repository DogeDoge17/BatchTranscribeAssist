i quickly threw this together in a few hours so things may or may not work but let's hope not.



basically how you use this is you give it a folder with a bunch of *.wav files and you can write something about it and it will neatly save it in a json file.

i made this so i could sort through a bunch of short audio clips and find the ones im looking for. i wrote  exactally what each clip said in the text box and i can search the json for later without needing to listen to every clip everytime i wanted to find something
